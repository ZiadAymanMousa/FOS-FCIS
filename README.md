# FOS-FCIS
This project is an implementation of dynamic allocation and page fault mechanisms in a free and open source operating system (FOS OS). The project involves designing and implementing these mechanisms within the kernel of the FOS OS, which is responsible for managing computer hardware and software resources.
Dynamic allocation is a memory management technique that allows programs to request memory from the operating system as needed. This is in contrast to static allocation, where memory is allocated at compile time. The implementation of dynamic allocation in the FOS OS will involve creating a mechanism for managing memory requests from programs, tracking available memory, and allocating memory blocks as needed.

Page fault is a mechanism used by operating systems to handle memory access errors when a program tries to access a memory location that is not currently in physical memory. The implementation of page fault in the FOS OS will involve creating a mechanism for detecting page faults, allocating new pages of memory to the requesting program, and updating page tables to reflect the new memory mappings.
